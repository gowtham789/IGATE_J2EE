ALGORITHM Check(A[0..n-1])
//Input: An array A[0..n-1] of n real numbers
x=A[0]; y=A[0]
for i=1 to n-1 do
if A[i]<x
x= A[i]
if A[i]>y
y= A[i]
return y-x

1.What does this algorithm computes?

Ans:It computes the difference between maximum and minimum element in the array

2.What is its basic operation?

Ans:Its basic operation is (if A[i]<x) and if A[i]>y

3.Check the no of times the basic operation is executed depends only on the size of an input or on any other parameter.

Ans:ALGORITHM Check(A[0..n-1])
//Input: An array A[0..n-1] of n real numbers
 x=A[0];
 y=A[0];
 sum=0;       //sum variable to count no. of times basic operation is executed
 for i=1 to n-1 do
 sum=sum+1;
 if A[i]<x
	x= A[i]
	if A[i]>y
	y= A[i]
end for
return sum;   //print no. of times basic operation is executing	
return y-x;

4.What is the efficiency class of the given algorithm?
A.The efficiency class of the given algorithm is Linear O(n).
