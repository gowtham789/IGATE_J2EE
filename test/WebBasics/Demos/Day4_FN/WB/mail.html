Using target="_blank“
This causes the link to open in a totally new browser window, with the page with the referring link still open behind it. Unlike JavaScript pop ups, the developer has no control over the size of the resulting window. It depends on what the browser did the last time before it was closed. 

Using target="_parent" 
This is similar to target="_top" but refers to the immediate parent of a frame. In more advanced frame usage there may be several nested frames. This allows more control over which frames are specified. (It is actually something developers rarely need to use).

Internet Service Provider (ISP):<BR> Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are companies that enable user to connect to the Internet . They offer an account on their systems and access to the Internet. 

Network Information Center (NIC): Network Information Center (NIC) assigns and regulates IP addresses on the Internet. You can get one directly from the NIC, or you can ask your ISP to secure an IP address on your behalf.

Internet Address: TCP/IP requires each host on a TCP/IP network have their own unique IP address. 

Internet Domain Name: A domain name maps or translates the actual numeric IP address used for your Web server into an easy-to-remember alphanumeric name. Domain refers to a collection of network host computers, known by the same name. Your domain name should reflect your organization or corporation, for example, .com , .edu , .gov , .int, .mil , .net, and so on.

Routing: Process of getting your data from point A to point B.

Gateway: Forwards datagrams to a destination if it knows where the destination is.

Protocol: specify interactions between the communicating entities. Example for protocol are TCP/IP, HTTP, telnet, etc..

Domain Name System (DNS)
It is as easy to identify computers with numbers, as it is to identify people with names. To bridge this dichotomy, the Domain Name System (DNS), a distributed database, was invented. Domain name maps or translates an actual, numeric IP address into an easy-to-remember alphanumeric name that your Web server uses.

Before DNS can do this for you, you must register any name you want to use.
Domain refers to a collection of network host computers, known by the same name. Your domain name should reflect your organization or corporation.
InterNIC (Internet Network Information Center) Registration Service, manages the task of assigning IP addresses and domain names to Internet users. 

Note: InterNIC (Internet Network Information Center) lets you apply for any domain name you like, regardless of your company name. The only restriction is that the name must be available and not already reserved by someone else.
Rightmost part of a name is called its zone. The next part is the name of the company. The part to the left of the company name is the particular machine within the company. Seven domains were established originally.
